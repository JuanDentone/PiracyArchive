# Piracy Archive
A complete backup of the Reddit r/Piracy sub

## The Archive 
This is a copy of every post with every comment from January 1st of 2016 to March 20th of 2019
It is currently located [here](http://rPiracy.ignorelist.com)

Plaintext Link: rPiracy.ignorelist.com

The link and the server ip may change later so save this repo rather than the actual link.

## Use
You should use the Post section to see what we would normally see on the front page of r/Piracy. Currently the search section is just a list of every link that you will have to scroll down to load and use Ctrl + F to search through it. I will be changing this later

This is a small server so please don't send a lot of requests or try downloading the entire thing becuase it is too large and will only result in the server either slowing down for everyone or crashing
